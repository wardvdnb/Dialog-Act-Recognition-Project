# Challenge: A deep dive into Dialogue Act Recognition (2024-2025)
**By**: *Ward Van den Bossche*, **Student ID**: *0605083*

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the Current Trends in Artificial Intelligence course at VUB, under the supervision of Dr. Leticia Arco Garcia. The objective of this work is to train a deep learning model to predict dialogue acts from sequences of utterances within a dialogue.

The dataset used for this project is best summarized by a statement from the official repository: "*The Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset consists of over 20k annotated multi-domain, task-oriented conversations between a human and a virtual assistant*" [[1]](#1).

These conversations span various domains such as banking, travel, and weather. Of particular relevance to this project are the dialogue act annotations, which are provided for both the system and the user. Some example dialogue acts include `INFORM`, `REQUEST`, and `CONFIRM`. A complete list of possible values can be found in the datasetâ€™s GitHub [README.md](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogue). Each dialogue contains multiple turns, and each turn is characterized by it's speaker, the spoken utterance and the dialogue act.

We will be working on a subdataset of SGD, provided by VUB's AI Lab in the files [TrainSet.json](/SGD%20Dataset/TrainSet.json) and [TestSet.json](/SGD%20Dataset/TestSet.json) *. The statistics can be observed below:

| Indicators | Train | Test |
|-------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Total dialogues | 5403 | 1331 |
| Total utterances | 82588 | 16850 |
| Total domains | 14 | 17 |
|Total USER dialogue acts | 11 | 11 |
|Total SYSTEM dialogue acts | 10 | 10 |
|Average dialogues per domain | 385,92 | 78,29 |
| Average utterances per dialogue | 15,28 | 12,66 |

We will consider RNN approaches in particular. In the process we will report on performance and try to analyse the models from different viewpoints. We will start from a basic model in the first implementation, inspired by the Deep Learning Course I followed at VUB, where an RNN based implementation was used in a sentiment analysis exercise. This implementation uses only the utterance as context, and is not pretrained on any other data. 

The second implementation follows the methodology proposed by Kumar et al. [[2]](#2). As cited there, the feature extractor is based on a pretrained [mLSTM model](https://github.com/openai/generating-reviews-discovering-sentiment/tree/master) used in Radford et al. [[3]](#3), and its PyTorch port [[4]](#4) was adopted for acquiring rich utterance embeddings. 

<small>* For debugging purposes, and in order to take a proper look at the documents, formatted versions can be found in [TrainSet_formatted.json](/SGD%20Dataset/formatted/TrainSet_formatted.json) and [TestSet_formatted.json](/SGD%20Dataset/formatted/TestSet_formatted.json).</small> 

## How To Run
To run the code the reader must:
- install the required libraries (see [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt)).

- download the **mlstm_ns.pt** from [here](https://github.com/guillitte/pytorch-sentiment-neuron/releases/tag/v0.1). Place this file in the [implementation_2](/implementation_2/) folder.

- Follow the two notebooks [implementation_1.ipynb](/implementation_1/Implementation_1.ipynb) and [implementation_2.ipynb](/implementation_2/Implementation_2.ipynb) respectively. The notebooks rely on different python scripts, which will be referenced at the appropriate times when following the notebooks. Simply run the cells in order, or observe the precomputed cells to view the results, most code cells are preceded by a description of what happens.

## Discussion

In order to get the full context of this discussion, the reader is urged to go through the notebooks first, as there they will find more results and visualisations about the experiments.

Both models show a strong overall performance, but the performance lowers w.r.t. rare dialogue acts. This is reflected in a performance drop of about 10%-14% when comparing regular with balanced accuracy. In a way this makes sense, since some combinations of intents simply are very rare, the 0 score in `USER_NEGATE|USER_GOODBYE`, for example, shows that it suffers from data scarcity (only 9 samples). The second implementation, however does well even in the absence of data, this suggests that the richer feature embeddings from the pretrained model, and context of previous utterances played a key role in improving performance. Intuitively, this makes sense, since a dialogue act like `USER_NEGATE` only makes sense after a system offer. The richer feature embeddings might help capture more nuanced differences in words.

A time per epoch of 75.70 seconds for the first implementation seems relatively low, but considering the small size of the subdataset, this was expected. At 50 epochs this training process took just over 1 hour to run. What's remarkable is the very low running time of the second implementation at an average time per epoch of 5.22 seconds. The fact that we precomputed the embeddings using the pretrained model for the utterances plays a big factor here. It must be noted that this process itself took quite some time as well, running for 15 minutes to process the test set alone.

The visualisations for both implementations show that a lot of the misclassifications happen between acts with multiple labels and their sub-label counterparts, for example `USER_THANK_YOU` is sometimes confused with `USER_THANK_YOU|USER_GOODBYE`. This is a byproduct of how the dataset was preprocessed, and for this reason it would be very interesting to see a multi-label variant of this project. We see that the t-SNE plots show proper clustering of dialogue acts, especially in the last implementation.

The ablation study for the second implementation shows that for this particular task and dataset, a context of 1 previous utterance does best. Increasing the context window results in a drop in performance, likely due to utterances from early states adding too much noise to our final hidden representation. As it stands, we use the mean hidden state, but it would be interesting to study the results on the final hidden state version as well. We also note the vast increase in training time as the window size increases, this could also be due to memory constraints, since the experiments were run on a pc with one GPU.

In conclusion, the first implementation shows strong performance in spite of it's lack of optimizations (less context, no pretrained model). The second implementation solidifies the idea that more context matters when it comes to dialogue act classification, but only to a certain extent, and depending on the task at hand. Finally, we can leverage pretrained embeddings trained on large corpora to transfer semantic knowledge.

## Future work

When it comes to dialogue act recognition, and this particular dataset, there is still a lot to explore in the future. Hopefully these models can serve as a benchmark for future implementations. 

A list of possible additions includes:
- Hyperparameter tuning for even better performance (hidden layer size, embedding size, etc.)
- Consider a Multi-Label variant of the dataset, where instead of grouping labels together like `USER_THANK_YOU|USER_GOODBYE`, we keep them separate and allow an utterance to have multiple labels
- Run an ablation study where either of these has been implemented:
    - stopwords have been filtered out in the precomputing step
    - where the first implementation has access to multiple utterances as context
    - the last hidden state is used in both implementations instead of the average
- Test the performance of classical ML algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, etc.
- Consider different representation strategies for (word) embeddings, e.g. Word2Vec or GloVe.
- Consider other Deep Learning Models such as transformers: BERT, GPT, etc.
- Test performance on the full dataset, and the sgd-x version to test generalization.
