test multi-label classification algorithms (think about other possibilities)
emotion recognition -> exclamations could be relevant
frequency -> if appears too much it might also be redundant (don't provide content)
(stop word elimination in python)
<unk> token -> look into other solutions?

for single utterances: decision trees, support vector based, etc.
feel free to test your approach with whole dataset
size vs model
consider how to represent the utterance, might influence classification
see in similar papers how they represent utterance
take a look at paper: "A Comprehensive Survey of Sentence Representations:
From the BERT Epoch to the CHATGPT Era and Beyond"
see if it's easy to apply (if you find code) how does representation influence the final result

visualize confusion matrix: true vs predicted classes
see where the classifier makes mistakes
