keep track of running time
double check utterance representation have a good argument for using it
document everything
discuss what you re-used from sentiment analysis and the paper

make a report - provide relevant information to reproduce what you did
describe data, paper chosen, first experiment, how I improved on the code 
(paper itself, different encodings, evaluation)

for evaluation:
- also add the metric balance-accuracy (classes are unbalanced -> 
  many utterances appear less than others (so accuracy might not be the best metric)
- confusion matrix (to see how the model behaves in different cases)
- quantify time 
- size of contextual information, how classical models behave

summarize lessons learned, main findings, conclusions 
(advantages and disadvantages)

upload notebook there and references to paper (i.e. everything needed to reproduce the approach).
